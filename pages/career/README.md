Create these pages or update links to match your content structure.

## Design Philosophy

- **Authentic tone**: Conversational, not corporate
- **Forward-looking**: Focuses on impact and future opportunities, not just past achievements
- **Values-driven**: Emphasizes leadership philosophy over technical skills list
- **Retro aesthetic**: Matches the site's existing design system using RetroCard, RetroBadge, etc.

## Routing

The page is accessible at `/career` and is already linked from the main index page in the "About Me" section.
